/* NOTE 1
    Initial thoughts are to write a function to check if a number is a palindrome. Then how can I go through numbers, and recognize a pattern that shows which will be palindromes. For example, is there an obvious reason that 91 * 99 results in a palindrome but 92 * 99 doesn't?
    Can that then be extrapolated to three-digit numbers.
